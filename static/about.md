The tool is an open-source, interactive hydrologic modeling application designed to estimate global river discharges using satellite-derived Total Water Storage Anomalies (TWSA) data. It integrates preprocessed TWSA data with machine learning (ML)-based regionalized hydrologic model parameters and spatial/temporal applicability classifications.
Key features include:
Interactive Map Interface: Users can select gauge locations on a map to compute discharge estimates (Q) and view applicability tags.
Model Flexibility: Users can choose from multiple ML models for regionalization, spatial feasibility, and temporal feasibility tasks.
Spatial and Temporal Confidence: The tool provides spatial and temporal dependency metrics (e.g., "good" or "poor" applicability) for each selected location.
Dockerized Deployment: The tool is packaged as a Dockerized application for local deployment, ensuring portability and reproducibility.
This tool demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in handling large-scale hydrologic systems and provides actionable insights for water resource management.
